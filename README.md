This project has two parts, one programmed on C++ and the other on Python. 

The C++ portion takes input values for certain spring properties and uses them to calculate outputs of position, velocity, and acceleration.

The Python portion takes the C++ outputs from a csv file and uses them to create three graphs of position, velocity, and acceleration vs. time.

This tool is currently developed to work on Mac 11.2.2 and hasn't been tested on other systems.

Latest available release with instructions are available to download on this page.
